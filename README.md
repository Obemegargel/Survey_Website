# Overview

I want to become a full stack developer so I am makeing a website that interests me.

I am making a "Rate My Apartment" website. Users in the local area will fill out a form that expresses the cost of the apartment for the semester as well as their satisfaction for the apartment overall. The information will then be averaged and displayed on the second page so people can have more updated information to make inofrmed descisions as to where they should stay for a particular school semester.

So far I have updated the front end side of things creating a form that can be filled out as well as a link to the information page. I still need to work on the back end and I would love to update the questions as I go to be more descriptive but still not so long people never answer the survey questions.
